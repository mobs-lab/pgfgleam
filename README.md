# pgfgleam
Probability generating function approach for epidemic metapopulation models.

This package provides class and functions to compute the PGF of observables, the underlying
distribution and/or the cumulants.

To install on unix systems, we recommend creating a python virtual environment. Then on the terminal move to the directory and run ```pip install .```

To run the demo notebook, you need installed [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org/install) or Jupyter
Notebook, and Matplotlib.
